/**
 * The Anomaly Detector API detects anomalies automatically in time series data.
 * It supports both a stateless detection mode and a
 * stateful detection mode. In stateless mode, there are three functionalities. Entire
 * Detect is for detecting the whole series, with the model trained by the time series.
 * Last Detect is for detecting the last point, with the model trained by points before.
 * ChangePoint Detect is for detecting trend changes in the time series. In stateful
 * mode, the user can store time series. The stored time series will be used for
 * detection anomalies. In this mode, the user can still use the preceding three
 * functionalities by only giving a time range without preparing time series on the
 * client side. Besides the preceding three functionalities, the stateful model
 * provides group-based detection and labeling services. By using the labeling
 * service, the user can provide labels for each detection result. These labels will be
 * used for retuning or regenerating detection models. Inconsistency detection is
 * a kind of group-based detection that finds inconsistencies in
 * a set of time series. By using the anomaly detector service, business customers can
 * discover incidents and establish a logic flow for root cause analysis.
