 *  - Terminal state will be determined by each strategy
 *  2.1 If it is terminal state Check if a final GET request is required, if so
 *      send final GET request and return result from operation. If no final GET
 *      is required, just return the result from operation.
 *      - Determining what to call for final request is responsibility of each strategy
 *  2.2 If it is not terminal state, call the polling operation call it and go to step 1
 *      - Determining what to call for polling is responsibility of each strategy
 *      - Strategies will always use the latest URI for polling if provided otherwise
